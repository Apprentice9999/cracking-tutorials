   6. KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH FLUKEVIEW

      Please note the following problems you may encounter when
      using FlukeView for Windows:

      a. When resizing a window results in large text characters, 
         disable the Windows setting "True Type Fonts Only".

         Start the Control Panel program and select Fonts, 
         View-Options, True Type and disable "Show only True Type 
         fonts in the programs on my computer".

      b. When the Windows Display Property "Show window contents 
         while dragging" is enabled, FlukeView will only show 
         interim updates while dragging Instrument Screen Windows.

      c. Due to last minute improvements of the software small
         deviations from the help file may occur.
