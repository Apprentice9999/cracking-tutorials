	Spelling Bee was designed to assist students in improving 
 	their spelling.  You enter the word. You record the word.
	Change the spelling list as the student progresses.  
	The student then listens to the word and spells it. 
	Unlike other Spelling programs you control what words the
	student learns to spell.  For any age student. Do you have
	a School Spelling bee coming up? Keep track of the students
	progress with the log file.  Progress for the current list
	can be reviewed at any time.

	edit it.  You can enter up to 100 words per Spelling list.

	button.  Play as many times as you like.  A different word
	will be selected until the list is completed.  All words
